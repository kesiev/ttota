# The Tomb Of The Architects

## TODO

Things I may add one day. That's quite _spoliery_!

- [ ] Add the missing SPECIAL room
- [ ] Add more unique assets for some room
- [ ] Complete architects.js data asking again to people. Eventually, extend
- [ ] Hang today's tomb Architects' personal items to room walls in the default rooms
- [ ] Is it possible to add hints to the floor?
- [ ] Add more (nasty?) vending machines
